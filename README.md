# preflighter
> Runs interactive pre-flight checklists

![example](docs/preflighter.gif)

Preflighter is a command-line utility that makes it simple to run small _probe_ scripts in order to visually confirm if a list of pre-flight checks are met.

## Installation

You can use `go get` to install the `preflighter` executable.

```sh
go get github.com/mesosphere-incubator/preflighter
```

## Usage

Invoke _preflighter_ pointing to one or more checklist YAML files:

```sh
preflighter path/to/checklist.yaml
```

The _preflighter_ will invoke the probe scripts for each test case and prompt the operator to visually confirm the outcome.

* Pressing `y` confirms that the value is correct
* Pressing `n` rejects the value and stops the test
* Pressing `s` skips (ignores) the value and continues with the next test
* Pressing `v` shows the `stderr` output (useful for debugging)

If a test has failed, the operator has the chance to re-start it.

## Tutorial

This short guide will help you getting started with writing your own custom checklist files. 

In all of the examples we are assuming that you are saving it's contents to a `checklist.yaml` file in your current working directory.


### 1. Simple Checklist

The following checklist demonstrates a very simple checklist:

```yaml
title: My Checklist
checklist:
  - title: "Does the date look correct?"
    script: |
      date
```

We are giving a `title` to our checklist, and we are adding a single item to the `checklist` array.

Each checklist `script` is assumed to be any valid `bash` script. It can be as complex as you like but it must return a single line on stdout. In our example, we are invoking the `date` command and we are asking the user to confirm.

You can run the checklist with `preflighter checklist.yaml`. This will display the following prompt:

```
==========================================
 My Checklist Pre-Flight Checklist
==========================================

  ‚ùî  Does the date look correct?         : Tue Mar 31 18:38:35 CEST 2020                                : OK? [Y/n/s/v]
```


### 2. Items that take long to complete



## Syntax

The checklist is a YAML file with an array of checks to perform. Each check is executed under `bash` and it's expected to echo it's output on `stdout`.

The `stderr` output can be used for debugging or progress messages. Feel free to dump a verbose stream of messages on `stderr` if your probe takes a lot of time. The operator can choose to see the message when needed.

For example:

```yaml
title: "Awesome Checklist"

checklist:
  - title: "Is cluster URL correct?"
    script: |
      dcos config show core.dcos_url
```

## Reference

Each probe script is executed in a `bash` environment, 

### Functions

The following accelerator functions available in the bash environment:

* **`cluster_curl`** `[<args>] <path>` : Calls-out to `curl`, with the DC/OS cluster URL and authentication headers pre-populated. For example:
    ```yaml
    script: |
      cluster_curl dcos-metadata/dcos-version.json | jq -r .version
    ```

* **`cached_cluster_curl`** `[<args>] <path>` : The same as `cluster_curl`, but caches the output for this session. 

* **`node_ssh`** `<arg> <command> [<args>]` : Calls-out to `dcos node ssh`, with the correct arguments in order to avoid error messages to pollute the standard output stream:
    ```yaml
    script: |
      local FOUND=$(node_ssh --leader ping mesosphere.io -c1 -t1 | grep -c 'not known')
      [ $FOUND -ne 0 ] && echo "Cannot resolve mesosphere.io" && return 1
      echo "Yes (resolved mesosphere.io)"
    ```

* **`cached_node_ssh`** `[<args>] <path>` : The same as `node_ssh`, but caches the output for this session.

### Variables

The following accelerator variables available in the bash environment:

* `${DCOS_URL}` - The URL to the DC/OS Cluster
* `${DCOS_ACS_TOKEN}` - The Authentication token to use for logging-in to DC/OS cluster

Additional variables can be defined using the `vars` object in the YAML object:

```yaml
vars:
  TARGET_NODE: "--leader"

checklist:
  - title: "Test"
    script: |
        node_ssh ${TARGET_NODE} ping mesosphere.io -c1 -t1
```
